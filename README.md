## üí° Motivation and Overview

Since a past couple of months I was so preoccupied with my college life that I was finding it hard to take out time for my fitness. Hence, came the idea for this project. A productivity app that helps you stay fit.
<br><br>**PomoTimer is a simple and configurable Pomodoro timer that provides a reliable way to track productivity using the Pomodoro Technique along with providing you customised exercise videos at the end of each work cycle.**

## ‚ú® Features

- **Beautiful UI**. The app has a minimalistic and intuitive UI making it pleasing to the eyes and easy to use.
- **Customizable rules**. You can easily modify the default rules of Pomodoro Principle to be fitted on your personal needs and likings.
- **Sound Notifications**. If enbaled, the app will notify you when a session completes. Useful when you are away from your computer while taking some break.
- **Customized Exercise Recommendations**. If enabled, the app will provide you customised exercise videos based on your preferences at every long break.
- **Open-Source**. PomoTimer is an open-source project. Feel free to create pull requestes for any new features or updates.üå±
